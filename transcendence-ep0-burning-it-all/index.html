<p>He stared intently at his simple cellphone, either organising his thoughts into a text message or expectantly waiting for his phone to speak to him with a rhythmic buzz.</p>

<p>An atmosphere enveloped him, that as much of anxiety as that of depression. A tiny little butterfly seemed to comfort him, fluttering around his knees. But its seemingly benevolent intentions may have foreshadowed a darker truth. That the pale yellow insect fed off his melancholy, was a more appropriate premise to this parasitic courtship.
